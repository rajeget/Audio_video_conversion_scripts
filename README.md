# Audio/Video format Conversion Bash Scripts

Automation bash script to convert audio , video formats using VLC CLI. There are so many ways to do this , and most of the documentation either works for only some formats or platforms . This effort is to just integrated every such code and create  a universal script which convert anyformat to any other format supported by vlc. Most of the work is taken from various sites and not truely my work .
